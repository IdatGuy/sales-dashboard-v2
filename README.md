## 📊 Key Components

### Dashboard Features
- **Sales Chart**: Interactive line charts showing sales trends over time
- **Goals Progress**: Visual progress bars for sales, accessory, and home connect goals
- **Sales Projection**: Smart forecasting based on completed business days
- **Commission Widget**: Real-time commission calculations and breakdowns
- **Leaderboard**: Employee performance ranking system

### Data Architecture
- **Context API**: Centralized state management for dashboard data
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation between UI and API calls
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Caching**: Efficient data caching to minimize API calls

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with seamless device adaptation
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## 🏗 Architecture Decisions

### Date Handling
- Fixed timezone issues by using explicit date parsing instead of relying on browser timezone interpretation
- Implemented safe date parsing to prevent off-by-one errors in date calculations

### Projection Logic
- Uses only completed business days for accurate monthly projections
- Excludes Sundays and incomplete periods from calculations
- Separate logic for monthly vs. yearly projections based on data completeness

### Performance Optimizations
- Memoized expensive calculations using React.useMemo
- Efficient data fetching with request caching
- Lazy loading of non-critical components

## 🎨 Design System

- **Color Palette**: Professional blue-based theme with dark mode support
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with proper font weights and sizes
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Components**: Reusable UI components following atomic design principles

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: 320px - 768px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px  
- **Desktop**: 1024px+

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication with Supabase Auth
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (Employee, Manager, Admin)
- **Data Protection**: Row-level security policies in Supabase
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation

## 🧪 Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: 100% TypeScript coverage for type safety
- **ESLint**: Comprehensive linting rules for code consistency
- **Component Structure**: Clean, maintainable component architecture
- **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling and user feedback

## 📈 Performance Metrics
